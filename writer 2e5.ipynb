      "Okay, so I need to solve the equation (x + 2)^2 = 0. Hmm, let's see. I remember that when you have something squared equal to zero, there's probably only one solution, right? Because squaring a number gives zero only when the number itself is zero. Wait, but maybe I should go through the steps properly.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, the equation is (x + 2) squared equals zero. So, if I take the square root of both sides, what would that give me? The square root of (x + 2)^2 is just the absolute value of (x + 2), right? But the square root of 0 is 0. So, that would mean |x + 2| = 0. And the absolute value of something is zero only when that something is zero. So, x + 2 must equal zero. Therefore, solving x + 2 = 0 gives x = -2. \n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, maybe there's another way to approach this. Let me expand the left side. If I expand (x + 2)^2, that would be x^2 + 4x + 4. So, the equation becomes x^2 + 4x + 4 = 0. Hmm, can I factor this quadratic? Let me check. The quadratic is x^2 + 4x + 4. Let me see if it factors into two binomials. \n",
      "\n",
      "Looking for two numbers that multiply to 4 and add up to 4. Well, 2 and 2 multiply to 4 and add up to 4. So, yes, it factors as (x + 2)(x + 2) = 0, which is the same as (x + 2)^2 = 0. So, that just brings me back to the original equation. \n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe using the quadratic formula? The quadratic equation is ax^2 + bx + c = 0. Here, a = 1, b = 4, c = 4. The quadratic formula is x = [-b Â± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / (2a). Plugging in the values, that would be x = [-4 Â± sqrt(16 - 16)] / 2. The discriminant (b^2 - 4ac) is 16 - 16 = 0. So, sqrt(0) is 0. Therefore, x = [-4 Â± 0]/2, which simplifies to x = -4/2 = -2. So again, the same solution. \n",
      "\n",
      "Hmm, so all methods point to x = -2. But just to make sure, maybe I can think about the graph of the function f(x) = (x + 2)^2. That's a parabola that opens upwards, with vertex at (-2, 0). The vertex is the minimum point of the parabola, and since the square is always non-negative, the graph touches the x-axis only at x = -2. Therefore, the only x-intercept is at x = -2, which means that's the only solution to the equation. \n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe considering multiplicity. The equation (x + 2)^2 = 0 has a double root at x = -2. So, in terms of multiplicity, it's a repeated root, but still, there's only one distinct solution. \n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but sometimes people might confuse equations like x^2 = 0 with having two solutions, but actually, since both roots are the same, they are considered as one solution with multiplicity two. So, in the real numbers, there is only one solution here. \n",
      "\n",
      "Let me check if there are any other solutions. Suppose x is a real number. Then (x + 2)^2 is always non-negative, so it can only be zero when x + 2 is zero, so x = -2. There are no other real numbers that satisfy this. If we consider complex numbers, but since the original equation is over real numbers (probably), then x = -2 is the only solution. \n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe I can plug in x = -2 into the original equation to verify. Let's see: (-2 + 2)^2 = (0)^2 = 0. Yes, that works. What if I try another number, say x = 0: (0 + 2)^2 = 4, which is not zero. x = -3: (-3 + 2)^2 = (-1)^2 = 1 â‰  0. So, only x = -2 works. \n",
      "\n",
      "So, after all these different methods and checks, I think x = -2 is the only solution. \n",
      "\n",
      "I wonder if there's a way this could have more solutions, but I can't think of any. Maybe if the equation was different, like (x\n"

Before that, the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906 existed, but the FD&C Act expanded its scope.\n",

Oh, and it covers cosmetics too, ensuring they're not misbranded or adulterated. The act has provisions for labeling requirements, like ingredient lists and nutritional information. There's also something about the \"new drug\" process, where manufacturers have to get approval from the FDA before marketing a new drug. \n",

The definition of \"adulterated\" and \"misbranded\" is important here. Adulterated could mean something is contaminated or unsafe, while misbranded might involve false labeling. \n",
      "\n",
      "Oh, and there are amendments over time. For example, the Kefauver-Harris Amendments in 1962 added requirements for drug efficacy. The Orphan Drug Act in 1983 is another amendment, but maybe that's part of a different act. The FD&C Act also covers medical devices, which might have their own classification system. \n",

      "Also, the act has provisions about color additives in cosmetics, which require preapproval. And for food, it's about ensuring that food is safe and not misbranded. The act's role in modern regulations is crucial, like in cases of food recalls or drug approvals. \n",
